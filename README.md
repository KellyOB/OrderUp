# Order Up

Week 13 Project for Devslopes Academy

You are going to create a bigger and better version of our cart app. This app is called OrderUp.  You will take your newfound knowledge of views and State and create a meaningful experience.

# Requirements
* Each list item will have an Add to Cart button
* When the Add to Cart button is tapped, the view switches to a stepper view and defaults to "1"
* If you subtract back to zero, the Add to Cart button returns
* If you tap the plus button the stepper increases
* The cart at the top right of the screen should reflect the total number of items added
* Selecting a new category in the horizontal list changes the row data
* Switch back and forth between categories should keep all data in tact (quantities)
* The cart should always reflect the total sum of all items added among all categories
* Make up your own category names and own item names, descriptions and prices
